# ATM
Used JavaFX to build a virtual ATM with a group of 4 classmates (Hisham Bajunaid, Adam Campbell, Omar Shams, Runze Song). 
Implemented object oriented programming with data structures such as: ArrayLists, and Arrays. 
A user has a pin and a balance with three different accounts: Chequing, Savings, and Credit. The user can transfer, withdraw, or deposite money across all three accounts with a transaction list that shows the latest transactions.
